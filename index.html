        <h1>SHUT DOWN</h1>

        <p>Lets cut to the chase. OFAH has been shut down.</p>

        <p>On August 15th, 2025, we pulled the plug on the service.</p>

        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <h2>1. Why did you shut it down?</h2>

        <p>The servers went offline for around 2 months due to other things we had to deal with. Whats funny is the whole servers were lead by 1 guy, so that was cool.</p>

        <h2>2. What is the new site for more products/What more is there to come?</h2>

        <p>Our new website, linked below this, is where we will post our new projects. More will come, as the website was made the same day we shut down OFAH.</p>
