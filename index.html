        <h1>One Frog A Hour</h1>

        <p>Do you like frogs?</p>
        <p>Do you read your email often?</p>
        <p>This is the place for you!</p>

        <button onclick="yes()">Yeah!</button>
        <button onclick="no()">No!</button>

        <p>Anyway, lets get serious.</p>
        <p>One Frog A Hour is a service that every hour, sends you a picture of a random frog.</p>
        <p>To sign up, you must read the rules.</p>

        <h1>RULES</h1>
        <p>1. You must own the email.</p>
        <p>Which means, it cannot be your MOTHERS email.</p>
        <p>2. No school emails.</p>
        <p>This is so people don't look at frogs in school, after all school is meant for learning!</p>
        <p>3. No company owned emails.</p>
        <p>This is so you don't get in trouble with any company, infact WE dont want to.</p>
        <p>4. No .gov emails.</p>
        <p>This is obvious. We do not want to get involved with the government, this is just a simple project.</p>
        <p>5. External domains</p>
        <p>Any domain name that is not related to a email service will be considered breakiing either rule 2 or 3, and will be suspected as spam, and will have you blacklisted.</p>

        <h1>APPEALING GUIDE</h1>
        <p>Appealing is simple, if you get blacklisted, you can either:</p>
        <p>1. Appeal to get unblacklisted</p>
        <p>2. Appeal for a REASON of why you got blacklisted, as this info can only be requested and not sent with your blacklist notice due to security.</p>
        <p>3. Both 1 and 2</p>

        <p>Keep appeals short and simple, here is a simple guide</p>

        <p>Dear the OneFrogAHour team,</p>
        <p>I request a (reason/removal of my blacklist) because I feel like I was falsely moderated.</p>

        <h1>HOW YOU COULD GET BLACKLISTED</h1>
        <p>Blacklists can happen for many reasons, most being hate speech, or replying to the bot (WITH hate speech), or flooding the support forum.</p>
        <p>Certain actions can result in certain bans, some being appealable, some not.</p>
        <p>Reputation matters too.</p>
        <p>The OneFrogAHour moderation team is working when possible.</p>

        <p>Are you ready?</p>
