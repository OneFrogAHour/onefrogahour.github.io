            <h1>The lore of OneFrogAHour</h1>
            
            <p>OneFrogAHour (better known as OFAH) is a email newsletter that had the first emails ran on May 10, 2025. The service lasted around 1 month, before the server suddenly went offline for 2 months, resulting in its official shutdown due to an unofficial reason. OFAH was known for its server being online in the day, down at night. The server was a Dell Chromebook 11 with the mrchromebox firmware patched onto it, running Lubuntu. The server is in the 'Hall of OFAH', as titled by the owners. The service came back early September, and it was at its peak. OFAH still runs, 24/7, and server outages are now put into notifications.
