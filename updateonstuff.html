  <h2>1/17/26</h2>

  <p>Hey all, its been a while since I've made a blog on the OFAH website. A couple of projects outside of OFAH have been released, but this is an update for those concerned on if the service will shut down soon or not. The service has a chance, but its very low.</p>

  <p>OFAH is still going to be online, just not updated for more features anymore. We have added all the features we possibly could, but we may add more to boost OFAHs awareness, to keep the service alive for longer if it ever has a risk of being shut down.</p>

  <p>Please use the Contact button below if you have any questions.</p>

  <p>Thank you for reading, and have a nice day.</p>
