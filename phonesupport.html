  <h1>The reason why we are considering</h1>

  <p>Many phone providers allow for email to be sent out with the Text-To-Mail and Mail-To-Text protocal. (as named by AT&T) We want OFAH to become a platform where no matter any situation where you can't sign up, we have a way for you to sign up. One issue we found with many of our public sign up sheets is people don't have a home email. The dev team goes to the same school, and we went around asking. Our main issue is, people sometimes don't have the right things to sign up.</p>

  <h1>The limit on AT&T operated phone lines</h1>

  <p>AT&T, Cricket, and all Bell companies ended TTM and MTT. This affected one of the devs family a lot, because they are AT&T customers.</p>

  <h1>How to sign up a phone number</h1>

  <p>You need to have any phone, it doesn't matter. Make sure it has a phone number attached onto it. Text the phone number ‪(551) 276-2058‬ with your phone number(s) and carrier(s).</p>
