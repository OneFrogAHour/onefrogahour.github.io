  <h2>11/10/25</h2>

  <h1>Its official; Phone number support is fully added to OFAH for non-ATT customers</h1>

  <p>After a little bit of work, its official. You can now sign up phone numbers for OFAH.</p>
  
  <h1>How it works</h1>

  <p>Phone number carriers have been known to make domains for emailing a phone numbers. For example, if someone is using T-Mobile and has the phone number 911 (This is an example, remember that), then the email to 'text' that number would be 911@tmomail.net.</p>

  <h1>Will I be safe with Email to Text?</h1>

  <p>Sadly, no. People like scammers, spammers, or tools designed to spam use Email to Text, which is what we use. Many companies are shutting down ETT, because simply put, some people suck and ruin the fun for others.</p>

  <h1>Can I help OFAH in anyway to keep support for phone numbers?</h1>

  <p>Please contact us directly.</p>

  <a href="mailto:onefrogahour@gmail.com">Email</a>

  <p>As normal, have a good day, and take care. -Kot, and Darrell</p>
