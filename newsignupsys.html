  <h2>12/9/25</h2>

  <p>Hi all, its been a while. Kot has been working on the new automated sign up system, and we are happy to announce it.</p>
  <p>Made in TurboWarp, it will help us, and finally give us a couple of breaks. But, this has some downsides.</p>

  <p>1. Adding emails manually was the main thing we did. If this ends up working, we may not work on OFAH anymore, but still keep it up. Many things that are confirmed are undone, and we don't know if we can finish it. We may make OFAH forkable soon enough if you would like to download it and host your own.</p>

  <p>Have a nice day, happy holidays, and thank you for being apart of this project.</p>
